I made a dummy memory slave which follows axi Stream Protocol to receive Data.
First of We will Discuss about RTL Design of AXI Stream Slave. 
It has Global Signals AXI clock and AXI Reset, It accepts the TDATA whenever TValid is High.
TValid_Last signifies That Last word is send from Master for Current Stream and Memeory Addresss Resets for Next Write Operation. Tready is Generated by slave.
Tstrb is strobe signal to decides byte to be write.


Now We will Talk about Test Bench.
We will Emulate like a stream Master. 
I am adding fake stalls to mimic similar behaviour to real life condition. For this purpose We make random signal by Xor Operation of Linera Feedback shift Register.
